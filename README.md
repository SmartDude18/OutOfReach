## <ins> Overview </ins>
In ***Out of Reach***, the world bends with every step. The goal retreats, the path reshapes, and every setback teaches you that nothing is as it seems.

## <ins>Key Mechanics</ins>

  #### Moving Goal
  - End goal stretches as the player gets closer to it
  - Players must traverse their patience to reach the end
  ### Checkpoint System
  - Checkpoints reset the level back to the start(except the first one)
  - Players must experiment and figure this out through trial and error
  - Later checkpoints may trigger other events
  ### False Traps/False Safety
  - False traps ellure the player into a false sense of security/danger
  - Players will trust something they belive is safe only to find it's not
  ### Invisible level
  - Some parts of the level are invisible without any player movement
  - Other parts of the level are invisible whilst moving though
  ### Dialogue On Death
  - Throughout the game players will be given a death dialogue hinting at how they died
  - This dialogue can also be incredibly sarcastic aiming to push players buttons and mocking them for dieing
